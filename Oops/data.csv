Python uses new lines to complete a command, 
as opposed to other programming languages 
which often use semicolons or parentheses. 
Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, 
to define scope; such as the scope of loops, 
functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.End of the python
